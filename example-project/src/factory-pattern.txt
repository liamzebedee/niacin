We have TakeMarket, which creates instances of TakeMarketShares

The "master template" for TakeMarketShares is deployed. It is instantiated, so it cannot be initialized by others (ie. Parity hack).

TakeMarket will create new TakeMarketShares. 
It clones the TakeMarketShares, by creating a new contract which delegatecalls to the existing template.
The clone is uninitialized at this point.
If TakeMarketShares had access to minting tokens for example, anyone might be able to mint before initialization. 
So we "instantiate" it first. Which permissions only the TakeMarket proxy to initialize. 
NOTE: this means we can upgrade TakeMarket, and it will still have the same permissions, as the clone has stored the proxy identity.
And then we call initialize. This separates the concerns from "permissioning" in the constructor, and allows us to initialize after doing other things.
