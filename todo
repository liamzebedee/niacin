- txs are free, no MATIC required
- you don't even need to connect your wallet. if you don't connect one, we make a virtual one for you
- users can make usernames without ENS (also gas free)
- make it possible to do anonymous takes

non-l3 version of this:
- wrap all contract calls in a relayer
    AA style
        replace msg.sender with _msgSender()
        delegate gas payment to a contract


- an alternative way to do this without backend code:
    // custom deploy script
    npm run deploy

    // do the proxy + other thing

    // convert artifacts into this format:
    type DeploymentTarget {
        name: string
        address: string
        abi: ABIItem[]
    }

    // store these in our API
    // only problem now is that the ABI's can be wrong.
    // but that's not so bad.


    // oh wait.
    // this means embedding a private key into the github app.
    // uhhhhhhh.

    // maybe we can do something different:
    // deploy locally. 
    // if the contracts are for testnet, then it works!
    // if it's for production, then whatever


    // what problem are we trying to solve?
    // a simple demo of web3 vercel

    // how can we do this the simplest?
    // - geth node
    // - one tx account
    // - instamine
    // - simple deployment pipeline for foundry
    // - output contract artifacts
    // - output deployed from commit
    // - upload them to api
    // - create new contract NPM package

    // and then somehow after all of this:
    // - deploy -> instantiates geth node
    // - project -> shows summary
    //   - rpc url
    //   - deployments
    // - make a commit, runs github workflow
    // - progress shows up on vercel
    // - artifacts later uploaded, parsed
    // - shows the contracts deployed and upgraded etc.

EVM Upgrade Pattern
    Proxy (name = EtherWrapperProxy)
        Owner = System
        Contract(name = EtherWrapper)
        setImplementation
    
    ContractRegistry
        mapping(string => Contract) public registry

        event Upgrade(string indexed name, address indexed newimpl);

        struct Contract {
            address proxy;
        }

        function upgrade(string name, address impl) {
            registry[name].proxy.setImplementation(impl)
            emit Upgrade(name, proxy, newimpl)
        }


EVM
    JSON-RPC
        getCode
        getTransactionByHash
        eth_getBlockByNumber
            load all of these from DB

    Node
        run(tx)
            gate tx based on token logic
                for first demo, it is a server token that is given based on idk.

            acquire lock

            run tx in ethereumjs-vm
                load code/storage/accounts from database
                execute tx
                
                get the new state leaves (code, storage, accounts)
                make tx receipt
                get prev block hash
                make the logs_bloom

                mint a new block (
                    parent_hash	
                    fee_recipient
                    state_root	
                    receipts_root
                    logs_bloom	
                    // prev_randao	
                    block_number	
                    gas_limit	
                    gas_used	
                    timestamp	
                    extra_data	arbitrary additional data as raw bytes
                    base_fee_per_gas	
                    block_hash	
                    transactions_root
                )
                insert into db
            
            release lock

            return tx_receipt
