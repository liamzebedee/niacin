- how to deploy contract to only one chain?
    maybe we can rewrite the aller deployer

    instead of assuming the contracts to deploy, it just takes a set of targets (names)
    and then we can deploy them to each chain

    ie. 

    aller deploy Collateral Loans etc. --chain optimism --manifest optimism.json
    aller deploy OptimismConfiguration --chain optimism --manifest optimism.json


    add option -a
    accept the argv of contracts before options
    remove the ignore from the .allerrc.js


- fix the tool so it is able to read the entire forge output files, not based on filename by based on contract name


ideally the tool would work like this:

   (contract abi's, RPC endpoint, manifest.json) 
-> (a set of unsigned txs to apply)
-> (new manifest.json)
